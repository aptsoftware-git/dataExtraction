Based on the data you provided, specifically the highly detailed "Compiled DIU 2025 (2)" sheet which contains the most comprehensive schema, here is the full list of 19 columns along with their domain-specific military intelligence details.
1. Date

The date the intelligence input was received or the event occurred. This is crucial for temporal analysis and establishing timelines of insurgent activity.
2. FMN (Formation)

Refers to the higher-level military organizational structure (e.g., Corps, Division, or Brigade) responsible for the geographic area.
3. AOR (LOWER FMN)

Area of Responsibility (Lower Formation): Specifies the smaller tactical formation (like a Sector or specific Brigade) that monitors this specific zone.
4. Unit

The specific battalion or regiment on the ground (e.g., 4 AR for 4th Assam Rifles) that collected the data or is responsible for the location mentioned.
5. AGENCY

The source of the information. In your logs, these include SIB (Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau), PHQ (Police Headquarters), ARFIU (Assam Rifles Field Intelligence Unit), and various EW (Electronic Warfare) Bns.

Indicates if the activity is domestic (India) or cross-border. Your logs frequently mention Myanmar, tracking safe havens and training camps across the International Maritime Boundary (IMB).

10. GP (Group)

The specific insurgent or militant group being tracked. Examples from your data include NSCN(IM), NSCN(K-YA), and NNC/FGN.
11. Heading

A brief subject line or "Title" for the report (e.g., Movement of Cadres, Extortion Demand, or Defection).
12. Input

The raw intelligence text or descriptive narrative. This contains the "Who, What, Where, and Why" of the report.
13. Coordinates
